# Telegram Payment Gateway Checker Bot

## Overview

This is a Telegram bot designed to check payment gateway availability and success rates. The bot monitors various payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, Adyen, Worldpay) and provides real-time status updates through Telegram commands. The system uses proxy rotation for enhanced reliability and anonymity when checking gateway endpoints.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular Python architecture with the following key components:

- **Bot Interface**: Telegram bot using the Telegram Bot API
- **Gateway Monitoring**: HTTP-based checking of payment gateway endpoints
- **Proxy Management**: Rotating proxy pool for request distribution
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration system

## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`main.py`)
- **Purpose**: Entry point and process management
- **Features**: Kills existing bot instances to prevent conflicts
- **Process Control**: Handles SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals for clean shutdowns

### 2. Configuration (`config.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized configuration management
- **Bot Token**: Telegram API authentication via environment variables
- **Admin Controls**: Whitelist of admin user IDs for bot access
- **Target Sites**: Predefined payment gateways with expected success rates

### 3. Proxy Manager (`proxy_manager.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages proxy rotation and health monitoring
- **Features**: 
  - Thread-safe proxy rotation
  - Failed proxy tracking with recovery mechanism
  - Multiple proxy format support (IP:PORT, IP:PORT:USER:PASS)
- **Resilience**: Automatic proxy recovery after configurable timeout periods

### 4. Payment Gateway Integration (`your_script.py`)
- **Purpose**: Defines payment gateway endpoints and configurations
- **Supported Gateways**: Stripe, Adyen, Braintree, Checkout.com, Authorize.Net, Worldpay, PayPal, CyberSource, Square
- **API Integration**: HTTP-based endpoint checking

### 5. Proxy Configuration (`proxies.txt`)
- **Purpose**: External proxy list management
- **Format**: Supports authenticated proxies with username:password format
- **Management**: Easy addition/removal of proxy endpoints

## Data Flow

1. **Bot Initialization**: Main script kills existing instances and starts new bot
2. **Configuration Loading**: Bot loads settings from config.py and proxies from proxies.txt
3. **Proxy Pool Setup**: ProxyManager initializes and validates proxy connections
4. **Gateway Monitoring**: Bot periodically checks payment gateway endpoints using rotated proxies
5. **Result Processing**: Success rates are calculated and stored
6. **User Interaction**: Telegram users can request status updates via bot commands

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **requests**: HTTP client for gateway endpoint checking
- **telegram-bot-api**: Telegram Bot API integration
- **threading**: Concurrent proxy management and request handling

### Payment Gateway APIs
- Stripe API (api.stripe.com)
- Adyen Checkout API (checkout-test.adyen.com)
- Braintree API (api.braintreegateway.com)
- Checkout.com API (api.checkout.com)
- Authorize.Net API (api.authorize.net)
- Worldpay API (api.worldpay.com)
- PayPal API (api.paypal.com)
- CyberSource API (api.cybersource.com)
- Square API (connect.squareup.com)

### Infrastructure
- **Proxy Services**: External proxy providers for request routing
- **Telegram Platform**: Message delivery and bot hosting

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **TELEGRAM_TOKEN**: Set via environment variable for security
- **Proxy Configuration**: External file-based proxy management
- **Admin Access**: Hardcoded admin IDs for initial access control

### Process Management
- **Single Instance**: Automatic detection and termination of duplicate processes
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGKILL
- **Auto-Recovery**: Proxy failure detection and automatic recovery

### Security Considerations
- **Token Management**: Environment-based token storage
- **Admin Controls**: Restricted access to authorized users only
- **Proxy Rotation**: Enhanced anonymity through proxy distribution
